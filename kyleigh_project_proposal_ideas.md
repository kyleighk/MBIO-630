## Idea 1: Pig trails

Pigs can leave prominent scars and trails that might be able to be
tracked by satellite imagery. I would be curious to compare the
effectiveness of the fences at containing the damage caused by the pigs
on the Oahu landscape. I would likely need substantial ground truthing
to confirm pig trails compared to hiker trails, car tracks, etc., and
the place of study would be a factor in the feasibility of this
comparison. An area with high traffic in addition to the pigs would
likely complicate the analysis rapidly and create a greater need for
ground truthing. However, satellite imagery could be used to identify
the presence of pigs in more remote areas of the island that would be
used to control the fences. This would be a benefit to using satellite
imagery if it is more difficult for people to access. Beyond using a
satellite imagery program, likely Planet, since high resolution would be
a must for this project, pictures on the ground and locating pig trails
seen from the satellite would be necessary. This means people and
cameras would also be needed.

## Idea 2: Surfing influx

With covid and the stay-at-home order affecting Oahu, more people were
out in the water surfing since there wasn’t much else to do, and people
were not allowed to stay on the beach unless they were in the water
doing an activity. Counting people in the water and the changes from
before, during, and after covid on the surf breaks would be an exciting
project. My question for this would be if there were a significant
difference in the number of people in the water at these different time
points. I would likely analyze the years 2018/2019, 2020, and 2021/2022.
I suspect the difference in surfers to be significant, which would be
essential for the effects of people on the coral reefs. I see a lot of
surfers standing on the coral, bringing in a lot of pollutants or
causing damage to the reef by scraping it with their boards. Since
boards are large and bright, I suspect only an average imagery program
would need to be used, such as Google Earth. The tricky part would be
identifying those with shortboards or more neutral tones. I will need to
find a balance in resolution if I continue with this project.

## Idea 3: Covid reef changes

Similar to the idea of the surfers increasing with covid hitting Oahu,
the reef around Oahu was likely to change since some spots no longer had
as many people around (e.g., Haunama Bay), and others saw a significant
influx of people in the water (e.g., Ala Moana area) during this time. I
would like to answer the questions of how certain reefs around the
island may have changed with the arrival of covid and the stay-at-home
order. I would use a high-resolution imagery program like Planet
Explorer and compare reef areas similar to how we studied the patch reef
in Kāneʻohe Bay. I would find out how the reefs changed from Hanauma
Bay, Ala Moana area, Electrics, and Sharks Cove. Ideally, I would try
and have some ground truthing to confirm the places I would study with
the satellite imagery. I would use GPS and transect, likely similar to
how we conducted the study on the patch reefs.
